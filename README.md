# Underwater-Broadband-Communication

The current project aims to design and implement an acoustic system for underwater communication. The current work combines a theoretical part, whose objective is to choose the appropriate techniques to deal with the characteristics of the targeted channel, and a 
practical implementation regarding the system deployment and experimental tests. 

# **Research**
For our theoretical research, we have focused on
* Noise and loss models
* Modulation detection techniques
* Channel estimation algorithms
* Signal to noise ratio(SNR)

# **Implementation**
For the implementation of our models, we have focused on
* Modelling various noises and losses using Simulink
* Implementing the selected techniques
* Software Simulation using MATLAB
  - Debug the program
  - Tune the chosen parameters
  - Analyze results
