# Underwater-Broadband-Communication

It is mainly a research oriented project that aims to design and implement an acoustic system for underwater communication. Our current work combines a theoretical part where we choose the appropriate technique to deal with the characteristics of the targeted channel, and a practical implementation regarding the system deployment and experimental tests. 

# **Theoretical Research**
For our theoretical research, we have focused on
* Noise and loss models.
* Modulation detection techniques
* Channel estimation algorithms
* Signal to noise ratio(SNR)
